# <p align="center">EasyPasswordManager</p>
EasyPasswordManager is a simple program that helps you store all your credentials locally.

It uses a SQLite database which is embedded directly in the jar file, so you can simply move/copy the executable from one pc to another (with JVM installed) and keep all your data.

Keep in mind that EasyPasswordManager doesn't aim to be an "ultra safe" tool, all your credentials are protected by a single master Password, so if someone who uses your pc knows it he can see all your data.
<br/>Also someone who is familiar with SQLite can, with a little bit of work, access your data without using the application (I don't tell you how to do it obviously).
